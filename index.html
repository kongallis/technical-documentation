        <p>
          Ruby is a flexible and intuitive object-oriented programming language.
          From modest beginnings in Japan where it rapidly gained a loyal
          following, the popularity of Ruby has now spread throughout the
          programming world. This surge in popularity can, in no small part, be
          attributed to the introduction and wide adoption of the Ruby on Rails
          framework. It is difficult, however, to get the most out of Ruby on
          Rails without first learning something about programming in Ruby, and
          this is where Ruby Essentials comes in.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ruby Essentials is a free on-line book designed to provide a concise
          and easy to follow guide to learning Ruby. Everything from installing
          Ruby and the basics of the language through to topics such as arrays,
          file handling and object-oriented programming are covered, all
          combined with easy to understand code examples which serve to bridge
          the gap between theory and practice. Ruby Essentials is intended to be
          of equal use both to those experienced in other programming languages
          and to novices who have chosen Ruby as their "first programming
          language".

      <section id="Why_is_Ruby_so_popular" class="main-section">
        <header>Why is Ruby so popular</header>
        <p>Ruby's popularity is based on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Firstly, Ruby is a very intuitive and clean programming language.
            This makes learning Ruby a less challenging task than learning some
            other languages. Ruby is also a great general purpose language. It
            can be used to write scripts in the same way you might use Perl and
            it can be used to create full scale, standalone GUI based
            applications. Ruby's usefulness doesn't end there however. Ruby is
            also great for serving web pages, generating dynamic web page
            content and excels at database access tasks.
          </li>
          <li>
            Not only is Ruby intuitive and flexible it is also extensible,
            enabling new functionality to be added through the integration
            third-party, or even home grown libraries.
          </li>
          <li>
            And, of course, being an interpreted language means that Ruby is
            portable. Once an application has been developed in Ruby it will run
            equally well on Ruby supported platforms such as Linux, UNIX,
            Windows and Mac OS X.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Programming guides tend to follow the tradition of using "Hello World"
          as the first example of using a programming language. Typically such a
          program does nothing but output the string "Hello World" to the
          console window. Ruby Essentials is no exception to this rule, though
          we will modify it slightly to display "Hello Ruby!". Without further
          delay, let's get started:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            On Linux or UNIX derived operating systems:<br />
            <code>print "Hello Ruby!\n"</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            On Windows:<br />
            <code>print "Hello Ruby!" </code>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          As you can see, all we need to do to output some text is enter a
          single line of Ruby code. You may recall if you have read the previous
          chapters that one of the strengths of Ruby is that it is fast and
          intuitive to learn. Clearly it would be hard to make printing a line
          of text any easier than a print statement followed by the text to be
          displayed (together with a newline character '\n' on Linux and UNIX).
          As an example, let's compare this to the equivalent code in Java:
        </p>
        <code>
          import java.io.*;<br />
          public class Hello { <br />public static void main ( String[] args) {
          <br />System.out.println ("Hello Ruby!\n");<br />
          }<br />
          }
        </code>
      </section>
      <section id="Single_Line_Comments" class="main-section">
        <header>Single Line Comments</header>
        <p>
          Single line comments in a Ruby script are defined with the '#'
          character. For example, to add a single line comment to a simple
          script:
        </p>
        <code>
          # This is a comment line - it explains that the next line of code
          displays a welcome message print "Welcome to Ruby!"
        </code>
        <p>Comments lines can be grouped together:</p>
        <code>
          # This is a comment line <br />
          # it explains that the next line of code displays <br />
          # a welcome message
        </code>
      </section>
      <section id="Variables_and_Assignment" class="main-section">
        <header>Variables and Assignment</header>
        <p>
          So far, whenever we have putsed a string or a number, the thing we
          putsed is gone. What I mean is, if we wanted to print something out
          twice, we would have to type it in twice:
        </p>
        <code>
          puts '...you can say that again...' <br />
          puts '...you can say that again...'
        </code>
        <p>
          To store the string in your computer's memory, we need to give the
          string a name. Programmers often refer to this process as assignment,
          and they call the names variables. This variable can be just about any
          sequence of letters and numbers, but the first character needs to be a
          lowercase letter. Let's try that last program again, but this time I
          will give the string the name myString (though I could just as well
          have named it str or myOwnLittleString or henryTheEighth).
        </p>
        <code>
          myString = '...you can say that again...' <br />
          puts myString <br />
          puts myString
        </code>
      </section>
      <section id="Flow_Control" class="main-section">
        <header>Flow Control</header>
        <h4>Comparison Methods</h4>
        <p>
          Let's rush through this part so we can get to the next section,
          Branching, where all the cool stuff happens. So, to see if one object
          is greater than or less than another, we use the methods > and <, like
          this:
        </p>
        <code>
          puts 1 > 2 <br />
          puts 1 < 2
        </code>
        <p>
          false <br />
          true
        </p>
